  Warning:  I am sorry that I can't properly find unit cell with the first two v
 ectors
  defined in the SURFACE card that have the same volume as the original one.
  Now, I will use my own method to choose the SURFACE card. But don't worry, 
  The new surface card we found is just for the surface you defined. However, 
  you should notice that the first and the second vectors in the SURFACE card 
  could be changed which would affect the slab reciprocal lattice vectors.
